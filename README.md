â€¢ Figuring out a C++ executable to delete all instances in AWS Lambda;

# Sub-goal
1. Suppose there are some players in Blackjack. For example, let's say we are having three players in a play room. We consider the current point of a play a component in a vector, v.\
Thus, dim(v) == 3. Between the DB, which is either DynamoDB/MySQL, and a player side (written in C# based on Unity), we just need to update the component accordingly every time. For example (1/*,2,3),\
A is every point as the player desires; could be changed to (1/*,4,3). Using vectors like that is better cuz the app is more scalable when we are applying AI structure to it. Most likely data tuning from\
Scikit-learn and neural networks in TensorFlow. Depends on the dimensions, we might need to use Word2Vec during the process of embedding.
